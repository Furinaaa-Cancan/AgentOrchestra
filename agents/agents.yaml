# AgentOrchestra — Agent Registry
# 
# Map your IDE tools to roles. You can use ANY IDE here.
# The system only cares about roles (builder, reviewer), not IDE names.
#
# Examples:
#   - windsurf, cursor, kiro, codex, antigravity, copilot, aider, cline, ...
#
# To add a new IDE, just add it here. No code changes needed.
